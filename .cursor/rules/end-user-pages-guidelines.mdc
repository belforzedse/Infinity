# End-User Pages Guidelines

**Description**: This rule provides general guidelines for all customer-facing pages in the e-commerce platform. Use this rule as a reference when building new pages, components, or features to ensure consistency in design patterns, responsiveness, data fetching, and performance across the entire user experience.

This guide covers consistent patterns and best practices for all end-user facing pages:

## Common Layout Structure
- All end-user pages follow Next.js App Router architecture
- Pages are organized in route groups:
  - `(product)` - Main shopping pages (Home, PLP, PDP)
  - `(public)` - Authentication and public information pages
  - `(user)` - User account and cart pages

## Responsive Design Principles
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Breakpoints follow Tailwind defaults:
  - `md:` for tablet/medium screens (768px)
  - `lg:` for desktop/large screens (1024px)
- Flex and grid layouts that adjust based on viewport
- Consistent padding pattern: `px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-16`
- Max width constraint: `max-w-screen-xl mx-auto`

## Component Patterns
- Reusable product cards with consistent props interface
- Consistent hero sections for each page type
- Shared UI components for product information display
- Common navigation elements (breadcrumbs, filters)

## Data Fetching Strategy
- Server components fetch data directly from API
- API calls to Strapi backend using standard patterns
- Consistent data transformation for component props
- Client components use hooks for interactive features
- URL parameters for state management (filters, pagination)

## Image and Media Guidelines
- Use different image sizes for mobile/desktop when needed
- Image paths follow consistent patterns
- Images have proper alt tags for accessibility
- Video content supported in product galleries

## Performance Considerations
- Keep component files under 150 lines
- Remove unused imports and dead code
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Optimize image delivery with appropriate formats

## Product Information Display
- Consistent information hierarchy across pages
- Product cards show: image, category, title, price
- Discounted prices shown with original price strikethrough
- Rating and popularity indicators where applicable
