# PDP Schema and Structure

This rule documents the Product Detail Page (PDP) schema, component structure, and functionality in the Infinity Store application.

## PDP Route and Component Structure

The main PDP component is at [src/app/(product)/pdp/[slug]/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(product)/pdp/[slug]/page.tsx), which uses dynamic routing with the product slug parameter.

The PDP is organized as a vertical flex column with spacing between sections:

```
PDP Page
├── Breadcrumb - Navigation path showing category hierarchy
├── Hero Section
│   ├── PDPHeroGallery - Product images and video gallery
│   └── PDPHeroInfo - Product details and purchase options
├── OffersList (Multiple) - Related product recommendations
├── PDPComment - Product reviews and ratings
└── PDPHeroInfoFAQItem - SEO description and product information
```

## Hero Section Components

The Hero section is the most complex part of the PDP, handled by [src/components/PDP/Hero/index.tsx](mdc:src/components/PDP/Hero/index.tsx).

### Hero Gallery

The [src/components/PDP/Hero/Gallery/index.tsx](mdc:src/components/PDP/Hero/Gallery/index.tsx) component displays product images and videos with:
- Thumbnail gallery for quick selection
- Main image/video view
- Next/previous navigation
- Support for both image and video content

### Hero Info

The [src/components/PDP/Hero/Info/index.tsx](mdc:src/components/PDP/Hero/Info/index.tsx) component shows product information:
- Product title and category
- Pricing with original and discounted prices
- Color options with visual swatches
- Size options with detailed measurements
- Add to cart functionality
- Product specifications and descriptions

## Product Data Schema

The product data model is defined in [src/services/product/product.ts](mdc:src/services/product/product.ts) and includes:

```typescript
interface ProductDetail {
  id: number;
  attributes: {
    Title: string;
    Description: string;
    Status: 'Active' | 'InActive';
    AverageRating?: number;
    RatingCount?: number;
    CleaningTips?: string;
    ReturnConditions?: string;
    CoverImage: { data: ProductMedia };
    Media: { data: ProductMedia[] };
    product_variations: { data: Array<ProductVariation> };
    product_main_category: { data: ProductCategory | null };
    // ... other fields
  };
}
```

## Responsive Design

The PDP uses responsive design patterns:
- Mobile: Stacked layout with title at the top
- Desktop: Side-by-side layout with gallery on left, info on right
- Uses `flex-col md:flex-row` pattern for responsive layouts
