# Home Page Layout

**Description**: This rule documents the structure, components, and patterns used for the e-commerce home page. Use this rule when working on home page features, adding new sections, or modifying the existing layout to maintain consistency with the established design patterns.

The Home Page is structured as follows:

## Main Structure
- The main component is in [src/app/(product)/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(product)/page.tsx)
- Uses responsive design with different layouts for mobile and desktop views
- Maximum width is constrained with `max-w-screen-xl mx-auto`

## Key Sections
1. **Hero Section** - Main banner at the top with responsive images for mobile/desktop
2. **Secondary Banners** - Flex layout with different arrangements on mobile vs desktop
3. **Discounted Products Section** - Shows products with discounts using `OffersListHomePage` component
4. **Categories Section** - Grid display of product categories with images and backgrounds
5. **New Products Section** - Uses `OffersListHomePage` with `NewIcon` component
6. **Popular Products Section** - Shows highest rated products

## Data Fetching
- Uses server components with `async` functions
- Data is fetched in parallel with `Promise.all`
- Fetches data from Strapi backend API endpoints
- Transforms API responses to match the component props structure

## Product Cards
- Product data is transformed to include:
  - Product ID
  - Images array with URLs
  - Category
  - Title
  - Price information (original and discounted)
  - Additional metrics like view counts

## Responsive Design Guidelines
- Mobile-first approach with responsive classes
- Different image sources for mobile vs desktop
- Uses Flexbox for layout with column direction on mobile, row on desktop
- Consistent padding with `px-4 md:px-8 lg:px-16`
