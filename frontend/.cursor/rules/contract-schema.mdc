# Contract Schema

## Contract Models

The contract system consists of:

- [Contract](mdc:src/api/contract/content-types/contract/schema.json) - The main contract model
  - Defines agreements between users or between users and the platform
  - Contains contract terms, conditions, and status
  
- [Contract Transaction](mdc:src/api/contract-transaction/content-types/contract-transaction/schema.json) - Transaction records for contracts
  - Records financial transactions related to contracts
  - Tracks payment history and status
