# Super Admin CRUD Operations

This document outlines the patterns and best practices for implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the Super Admin section.

## Service Functions

All API service functions should be organized in the `src/services/super-admin` directory, following this structure:

- `src/services/super-admin/{entity}/{operation}.ts`

For example:
- [src/services/super-admin/product/create.ts](mdc:src/services/super-admin/product/create.ts)
- [src/services/super-admin/product/update.ts](mdc:src/services/super-admin/product/update.ts)

## Hooks

Custom hooks for managing entity-specific operations should be created in the `src/hooks` directory:

- [src/hooks/product/useCategory.ts](mdc:src/hooks/product/useCategory.ts)
- [src/hooks/product/useTag.ts](mdc:src/hooks/product/useTag.ts)
- [src/hooks/useIndexImageUpload.ts](mdc:src/hooks/useIndexImageUpload.ts)

## Type Definitions

Type definitions for data models should be created in the `src/types/super-admin` directory:

- [src/types/super-admin/products.ts](mdc:src/types/super-admin/products.ts)

## Form Handling

Forms for creating and updating entities should:
1. Use React Hook Form for form validation and submission
2. Include proper error handling and validation messages
3. Show loading states during API calls
4. Redirect or show confirmation on successful submission

## Table Actions

Table rows should include action buttons for common operations:
- Edit/Update
- Delete/Remove
- View Details

Example implementation:
- [src/components/SuperAdmin/Table/Cells/ActionButton.tsx](mdc:src/components/SuperAdmin/Table/Cells/ActionButton.tsx)
- [src/components/SuperAdmin/Table/Cells/RemoveActionButton.tsx](mdc:src/components/SuperAdmin/Table/Cells/RemoveActionButton.tsx)

## Modal Dialogs

Use modal dialogs for:
- Confirmation before delete operations
- Quick edits that don't require a full page
- Viewing additional details

## Error Handling

All API calls should include proper error handling:
1. Display user-friendly error messages
2. Log detailed errors for debugging
3. Provide recovery options when appropriate
